Create a BMI calculator Program Description 

The program should allow the user to enter a person’s weight in stones and pounds and then convert the entered weight to kilograms or converts the weight entered in kilograms to Stones and pounds.

The program should allow the user to enter a person’s height in feet and inches and then convert the entered height to centimetres or converts the height entered in centimetres to feet and inches.

The program should then calculate the BMI and display the result.  The program should also display further information telling the user if the persons BMI indicates if they are underweight, normal, overweight or obese using the values shown in this table. 

BMI VALUES
Underweight	 less than 18.5
Normal (heathy weight) 	 between 18.5 and 24.9
Overweight	 between 25 and 29.9
Obese	 30 or greater

BMI Formulae
BMI is calculated using either of the following formulae:
English Imperial BMI Formula
BMI = (Weight in Pounds / (Height in inches x Height in inches)) x 703
Metric BMI Formula
BMI = (Weight in Kilograms / (Height in Meters x Height in Meters))

You only need to use one of the above as your program will contain all the values in both the imperial and metric systems.
The program should ensure that the user enters valid (numeric /positive / appropriate range) values only. If the user enters incorrect values the program should request new values.
